▶️ How to Run the Automation Framework (Step-by-Step)

This project contains two independent automation layers:

Playwright UI Automation – validates chatbot UI behavior & security

Promptfoo AI Validation – validates AI response quality & reliability

You can run either one independently or both together.

1️⃣ Prerequisites

Make sure the following are installed on your system:

node --version     # v18 or higher
npm --version


2️⃣ Project Setup
Step 1: Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/shilpasaware/Case-Study-AI-ML-QA-Automation.git
cd u-ask-automation

Step 2: Install dependencies
npm install

Step 3: Install Playwright browsers
npx playwright install

3️⃣ Environment Configuration

Create a .env file in the project root (this file is not committed):

BASE_URL=https://ask.u.ae


ℹ️ This allows easy environment switching without changing code.

4️⃣ Run Playwright UI Automation
Run all UI tests
npm test

Run only UI behavior tests
npm run test:ui

Run security / injection tests
npm run test:security

Run tests in headed (visible) mode
npm run test:headed

View Playwright HTML report
npm run report


📍 Report location:

playwright-report/index.html

5️⃣ Run Promptfoo AI Validation Tests

Promptfoo tests validate AI response quality, not UI behavior.

Run Basic AI tests
npm run promptfoo:basic

Run Moderate AI tests
npm run promptfoo:moderate

Run Advanced AI tests
npm run promptfoo:advanced

Run Negative / Hallucination tests
npm run promptfoo:negative

Run all AI tests together
npm run promptfoo:all

6️⃣ View Promptfoo Results
Open Promptfoo local viewer
npm run promptfoo:view


📍 Results are also saved under:

output/


Each run generates a JSON report with:

Pass / Fail status

Assertion reasons

Latency & stability data
